My Motivation To Build This Project
-As we are in recruitment season and we apply to countless internships, in most cases we forget which companies we applied to and for what position and also since every company has their own criteria for international students and information, sometimes it gets confusing.. I personally keep track of my internship applications in an excel spreadsheet by creating fields like company name, position, status, recruiter contact, date applied, sponsorship, remote/in-person,  and so on. In my project, I want to convert the idea of spreadsheet into a database where the user can update all the fields, and also have an option to filter the information by sorting out the specific field which will make looking for information easier in case there are hundred of datas.  

Major Challenges in Implementation
- One of the major challenges in implementation was to connect my database with SQL. After many failed attempts, I was able to connect it. Also, for my 'Search by' and 'Show All' features, I faced challenge, even though code didn't have any error, these feature weren't working and after changing the ide to VS Code, these features started working.
