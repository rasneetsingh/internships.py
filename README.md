Name of Project
-TrackApplication

Description
-It is database where the user can enter the information in the fields, update, delete data.

Project's Goal
-As we are in recruitment season and we apply to countless internships, in most cases we forget which companies we applied to and for what position and also since every company has their own criteria for international students and information, sometimes it gets confusing.. I personally keep track of my internship applications in an excel spreadsheet by creating fields like company name, position, status, recruiter contact, date applied, sponsorship, remote/in-person,  and so on. In my project, I want to convert the idea of spreadsheet into a database where the user can update all the fields, and also have an option to filter the information by sorting out the specific field which will make looking for information easier in case there are hundred of datas.

How the program runs?

-To add new entry, the user will enter information in every field on the left side of database such as Company Name, Job Posting, Recruiter Contact and more and Press 'Add' and the record will be updated in the database.
Company Name and Job Posting are the required field, so if the user tries to skip it and press 'Add', 'Required to Fill All the Fields' will appear.
-To update already existing entry, user will tap in the entry on the right side of the table and it will appear in the left corner table and make changes as preferred and press 'Update' button at the bottom.
-To delete the existing entry, user will tap in the entry on the right side of the table and press 'Delete' button at the bottom on the left.

What technologies have been used to create this database?
-It's a GUI based application developed using Python tkinter module and SQL for backend.
 I used Tkinter to create GUI and construct buttons, menus, and data fields. I will also implement concepts of classes and objects to my project
